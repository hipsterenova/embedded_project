# embedded_project
This repository contains the complete source code and documentation for an embedded systems project that implements a medicine dispenser using the LPC2378 microcontroller. The system integrates multiple hardware components and peripherals, programmed in the Keil4 IDE, to automate the scheduling and dispensing of medicines.
Features
Microcontroller-Based Control:

LPC2378 development board programmed for precise control and integration.
Efficient use of timers, interrupts, and peripherals for real-time operations.
Stepper Motor Integration:

Used to control the mechanical dispensing mechanism for medicines.
Accurate and synchronized movements ensure reliable dispensing.
LCD Display:

Displays real-time status, schedules, and alerts.
Enhanced user interface with clear, readable messages.
Buzzer for Alerts:

Notifies users for critical events like missed doses or errors.
Keyboard Interface:

Allows users to input schedules and configure settings with ease.
USB Communication:
Facilitates data transfer and debugging with host systems.

Hardware Components

LPC2378 Development Board: ARM7 microcontroller serving as the central control unit.
Stepper Motor: Mechanism to dispense medicines.
LCD Screen: Displays the system status and user information.
Buzzer: Alerts for critical notifications.
Keyboard: For inputting schedules and user settings.

Software Features

Interrupt-Driven Architecture:
Handles time-sensitive events and ensures smooth operation.
ADC/DAC Integration:
Reads potentiometer values and adjusts system parameters accordingly.

Keil4 Programming:
Code written and tested in the Keil4 development environment.
